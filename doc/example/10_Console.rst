10_Console
==========

This example shows how to use the **console** module.

It is possible to adjust everything to your needs, just pass in the
*ConsoleParam* when creating.

The most important functions you'll need are ``.log()`` and ``.llg()``.

And sometimes the string manipulations like ``.join()`` and ``.pad()``.
